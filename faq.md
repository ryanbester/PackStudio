# PackStudio FAQ

<section class="content-box" markdown="1">

## How do I install PackStudio?

PackStudio is very easy to install. Simply download the installer from [the downloads page](/download) for your platform, and run it.

Some elements of PackStudio require the PackStudio Minecraft modification to be installed. This can be downloaded from [the downloads page](/download) as a JAR file, and copied into your Minecraft mods directory.

## I do not have Java installed. Will I still be able to use PackStudio?

If you do not have Java installed, no problem. The PackStudio installer will automatically install the latest version of Java for your computer.

## When I run PackStudio, it says that JavaFX is not installed.

This could be because you are running a newer version of Java. Java versions 8 and below have JavaFX pre-installed. If you are using Java 9 or above, you will need to manually install JavaFX from [the JavaFX website](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).

## What are the system requirements for running PackStudio?

PackStudio does not require a super powerful computer to run. If your computer can run Minecraft, it'll be able to run PackStudio.
